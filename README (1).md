# 📊 Task 5: Sales Data Analysis using Pandas

## ✅ Objective
Analyze sales data from a CSV file to gain basic business insights using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **visualizations**.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `sales.csv` : Sample sales data
- `sales_analysis_fixed.ipynb` : Main analysis notebook

---

## 📌 Features / Steps Covered
1. **Load CSV file using Pandas**
2. **Data Cleaning (optional if needed)**
3. **Calculate Total Sales** (`Quantity * Unit Price`)
4. **Groupby & Aggregation**:
   - Sales by Product
   - Sales by Region
   - Sales Trend by Date
5. **Visualizations**:
   - Bar charts (Product and Region-wise sales)
   - Line chart (Sales over time)

---

## 📈 Sample Insights (from the dataset)
- Which product had the highest revenue?
- Which region performed best in terms of sales?
- How do sales trend daily?
